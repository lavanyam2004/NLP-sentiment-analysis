# NLP Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project was developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence module at NUS from March 2024 to April 2024. The primary focus is on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly sentiment analysis, utilizing various machine learning models and vectorization methods to enhance model usability across diverse datasets.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Implemented TF-IDF, Word2Vec and BoW vectorizations to convert text data into numerical format.
  - Cleaned and normalized data to ensure high-quality, consistent input for sentiment analysis.
  
- **Sentiment Trend Analysis:**
  - Conducted comprehensive data visualization to identify sentiment trends.
  - Analyzed the performance of different model-vectorization combinations to determine their efficacy in various themes.
  - Aimed to enhance insights and achieve broader model usability across diverse, unsorted datasets.

- **Model Testing:**
  - Achieved high accuracy on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the preprocessing and modeling techniques used.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** 
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and vectorization
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
